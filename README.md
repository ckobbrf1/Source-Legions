## Overview

This addon transforms static NPC shootouts into dynamic engagements. NPCs no longer fight to the death like mindless bots — they **feel fear**, **respond to losses**, and **retreat when overwhelmed**.

## Features

- **Dynamic Morale System** — NPCs react to battlefield conditions in real-time
- **Fear and Panic Mechanics** — overwhelming force causes NPCs to break and flee
- **Squad Awareness** — NPCs respond to allied casualties
- **Fully Configurable** — all parameters adjustable via configuration files
- **Extensible Architecture** — open API for third-party developers
